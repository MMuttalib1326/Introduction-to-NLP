# Introduction-to-NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). It helps machines process and understand the human language so that they can automatically perform repetitive tasks. 
What are the two types of NLP?
Syntax and semantic analysis are two main techniques used with natural language processing. Syntax is the arrangement of words in a sentence to make grammatical sense. NLP uses syntax to assess meaning from a language based on grammatical rules.
